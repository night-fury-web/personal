### Interview

- When interviewer asks tricky question for basic programming, explain briefly and tell him that nobody remembers all bases of fundamental things and they know it as it’s like instinct. The core is the business logic and the skill to solve problems and challenges.
- How to discuss with HR
  1. It does however mean that I don’t have the time to hop on a call with everyone who reaches out. A lot of the time, incoming messages represent a very poor fit indeed.
  2. I would love to continue the conversation, but before I do, I’d like to level set around the level of seniority that you’re looking for.
  3. Can you send along the company name, a job description and, total compensation details for the role you’re reaching out in reference to?
