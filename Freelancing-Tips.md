### Interview

- When interviewer asks tricky question for basic programming, explain briefly and tell him that nobody remembers all bases of fundamental things and they know it as it’s like instinct. The core is the business logic and the skill to solve problems and challenges.
- How to discuss with HR
  1. It does however mean that I don’t have the time to hop on a call with everyone who reaches out. A lot of the time, incoming messages represent a very poor fit indeed.
  2. I would love to continue the conversation, but before I do, I’d like to level set around the level of seniority that you’re looking for.
  3. Can you send along the company name, a job description and, total compensation details for the role you’re reaching out in reference to?

### Tips

- When I had no task to do, I studied most of day with little effort in cultivating my development experience. But it was wrong. Even though the project or task is very small, you will learn a lot and increase efficiency while working on it. So it's better to work on small jobs as well even it's worth of tens of bucks.
In freelancing world, reputation and feedbacks are important. Using online and offline time efficiently and creating a good daily plan are key for one's success.

- I am not sure if it's good to spend time to earn github badges and make contribution heatmap awesome(average heatmap is fine). In my experience, the less the client is concerned about github history, the easier the working with the client is. I guess the people concerned about your github will check the contribution on open source projects.
If you contribute to open source projects including raising issues, you'll get some organization contributions.
- Since there are a lot of jobs, it's good to apply proper filters not to spend too much hours for checking jobs. And do not miss a single job by checking job from the point you checked last time. Using this method, you can check the jobs while you're away and other competitors might be away at that time as well. So you have better chance to win the job among small number of competitors.
- Fixed job is also fine. In case you have bad review, just apply some small fixed jobs to overcome bad review. When you have a few ongoing jobs, it's time to increase hourly rate. One of my long term job was small fixed job at the beginning. Never give up. Some of my colleagues had also difficult time for over a few months. Just keep calm and do your best.
- Not sure if there is someone wants to get updated on my tips. :)
- Don't use all programming languages in cover letter. At the beginning use about 3 languages and a few fields that shows your skill. It's fine to add experiences in multiple services such as AWS Lambda, S3, EC2, etc. But fields and programming languages should be around 3 to 5. It shows your major skill and most of people don't believe freelancers who can do all things. Based on this, improve portfolio and cover letters by checking other well-going profiles. Important: Don't copy at all.
- Another strategy is that if you are really confident and eager to work on the job, update coverletter before applying.
- Be careful not to get detected by AI system. Get tips from colleagues.
- 3 years ago freelancer.com was fairly good for me. It's good for beginners and sometimes for professionals as well. Just use proper filter on job board and one day you'll win good job. If time allows, I may try it as well next year. The platform is also good as you can bid without concerning connect count.
- Good start it is. Don't miss any job post if it falls on your interested field. Though it's good to apply asap, it's fine to apply later when you see the post. Sometimes I spare total 4 hours a day to read all the past jobs from my last check.
- Nov and Dec will be a little slow, but prepare well for Jan which may have lots of opportunity. So improve skills during the slow period.
-	Friday is important and don't underestimate it for a job application.
-	When someone is asking how much time will it takes.
I know the idea of an open-ended bill is uncomfortable; how about I work on this for 1 to 2 hours, then update you on my progress. We can repeat or pause as needed, you’re in control
-	Not charging too little, or too much
Working efficiently, without compromising quality
Being generous, without being a doormat
-	May I repeat that back to you in my own words, to make sure I understand?
It makes them feel heard.
It makes you look smart.
It gives them confidence in you.
-	Learn from people who don’t do what you do.
You can learn so much that way. Chances are most of the people in your line of work are all mimicking each other. Studying outsiders helps you be a leader who brings fresh perspectives, ideas and techniques to your friend.
-	When you’re self-conscious about your prices, you attract clients who are price-conscious as well.
The opposite is also true: when you feel confident and easy about your prices, you attract clients who are happy to pay for value.
-	New freelancers worry about competing with more seasoned pros.
What they don’t realize is that those seasoned pros are:
    - Often already booked(and therefore not usually a threat)
    - Usually much more expensive (and therefore competing for different clients)
-	Change your thoughts, change your life.
    - I can’t afford it. => I could probably figure out a way to get it if I really wanted to
    - There’s only so much time in a day => 24 hours is a lot of time to get things done
    - It probably wouldn’t work for me => It could work …
-	A few among many things clearly propel someone in the right direction. You never know what might work, until you try.
-	Books are great but personal experience is the champion of all the teachers.
If others can do it, why not you?
- If you’re trying to get good at something and finding it frustrating, try being good at not being good.
That gives you the space you need to learn.
-	Great decisions are made from inspiration, excitement, and positive expectation.
Not-so-great decisions are made from overthinking, fears of missing out, or lack of belief in oneself.
-	There are no failures, only points along the path that help you clarify which direction you want to be headed in.
-	So many things we say, we phrase in the negative. Even when trying to say something positive!
Positive phrasing is a great habit.
-	Here is the main goal for proposal of freelancers.
Showing the client how you can help them accomplish their goal.
-	If I could estimate hours of a project, I’d have charged a fixed price, not hourly. Hourly pay works best when you don’t know how many hours something will take.
-	If my kids ever fall into a pattern of complaining, I ask them to name five things that are good right at this moment. Not only breaks the negative pattern, but reverses it into a positive one. The complaining stops and good things happen. (works for adults too)
-	I always believe in people. I’ve been broke, alone, depressed…
But the reality is that, at those times, money, love, and happiness were all surrounding me, trying to make their way into my experience. I just had to let them in.
The same is true for everyone else too.
-	You should allow someone competes with you. And both of you will get enhanced. Competition isn’t what it seems.
-	Preparing required documents and others are necessary and lifesaver. But don’t assume clients will do this. Do it for them( and for you)!
-	The secret to being a very profitable freelancer, while still paying upwork fees:
Build the cost of the fee into your prices. That’s it! It couldn’t be easier. Every business on earth does this to cover whatever their costs are – they bake it into their prices. You should too.
-	Great proposal: 
    - Personalized to client
    - Offer specific idea
    - Concise and right to the point (very much appreciated)
-	When you lost the job, you shouldn’t think “I lost that opportunity”. Instead
    - The client lost the opportunity to work with me.
    - It wasn’t a good fit anyway
    - There are better opportunities waiting!
-	How to get paid 
    - Take deposits
    - Require upfront payments
    - Choose reputable clients
    - Expect to get paid
    - Demand payment(when necessary)
    - Set clear payment terms, in writing
-	If you know where you’re headed, never be ashamed of where you’re at.
-	When a client doesn’t pay, you have 2 choices. You can get mad, or you can get smart. I chose to get smart.
-	25% of upfront is good to try.
-	Writing client red flags:
    - They want to pay per word (often in cents)
    - They need work done “urgently”
    - They say things like, “This should be a quick/easy job for the right person.”
-	Answer should be for 3 questions:
    - Why should I buy this?
    - Why should I buy it over a competing product ( or service)?
    - Why should I buy it NOW?
-	Things I’m not concerned with as a freelancer:
    - My Personal brand
    - Whether or not someone will like my work
    - Where my next client is coming from
    - Pleasing everyone
    - Networking
    - Having a broad portfolio
- Things I am concerned with:
    - Doing great work
-	How to be more creative & productive
Nap, Rest, Walk, Sleep, Breathe, Meditate, Massage, Don’t rush, Drink water, Pet a cat/dog, Don’t chase it, Take your time, Let it come to you, Experience nature, Put down the phone, Don’t beat yourself up, Don’t pressure yourself, Trust it will come to you 
-	Good communicators
    - I’m not available after 3pm -> I’m available before 3pm
    - I can’t get to it this week -> I can do this first thing next week
    - That’s not included in the price -> That will cost x-additional dollars
-	Think of the person you treat the best in life
    - The one you’re the most patient with
    - The most generous with
    - The one you’d never rush, or disrespect, or second guess, or berate
    - Now make a decision to treat yourself with the same amount of respect as you treat that person.
-	99.99% of your competitors have all read the same 20 books everyone’s been talking about for the past two decades. No advantage there. But if you read outside your industry you’ll think differently and more importantly you’ll sound better to clients than almost everyone else.
-	Invisible questions from clients
    a.	Are you capable of doing this job?
    b.	Will you make my life easier (instead of more complicated)?
    c.	Do you care enough to go to extra mile to help me succeed?
-	Make proposal successful
    a.	Show the client you read the job post
    b.	Talk about a relevant piece of work you’ve done
    c.	Tell them what makes it relevant!
    d.	Tell them what makes it special
    e.	Show them the work
    f.	Ask for a short voice call
-	The right way to introduce clients to your work:
    - “I recently did a piece of work that is very similar to what you’re looking for – you can check it out by clicking the following link …”
    - The lazy way to introduce clients your work:
      “Feel free to check out my portfolio”
-	Being too flexible can be a sign you’re not busy – which is not attractive to potential clients.
Don’t say “what time works for you?” Instead say, “here are some times I have available, do any of them work for you?”
Being busy is an attractive quality.
-	2 effective options for ending your upwork cover letters:
    A) ask a question(ideally something thoughtful, that shows your expertise and is easy for the client to respond to)
    B) invite the client to a call (voice or video) to discuss the project further
-	I combed through my portfolio and picked out a couple of examples of my work which I believe are highly relevant to what you're looking for. I've attached both of them here for your convenience.
-	Tips to help you get more clients
    a.	Call clients by their name
    b.	Compliment them
    c.	Talk about their goals
    d.	Ask thoughtful questions about their business
    e.	Give them good advice
    f.	Map out a plan for helping them
    g.	Be a good listener (listen more than you talk)
-	Clients are often willing to pay significantly more than the budget they include in their job post
-	Impress clients by asking them about their three favorite topics.
(Then be quiet and let them talk. They will love you. They will walk away from the conversation wanting to talk with you again very soon.)
    a.	Themselves
    b.	Their business
    c.	The projects they are working on 
-	Clients like to hire freelancers who are confident.
-	“How do I convince clients I am worth my price?”
First convince yourself. Then clients will believe it, because you believe it.

#### Tips from freelancers

-	“If you want to make a profile that stands out, focus on the results you deliver for the client. Be clear about who you help and how you can help them. Try to make sure your profile says “you” more than “I” and is speaking directly to your ideal client. It’s worked for me!”
-	“Keep it short but impactful, highlighting your field of expertise. Clients want to know the length of your practice. Lastly, have an online portfolio where they can see the works you have gathered through the years. No sales talk, it’s cheap.”
-	“Make a profile video and stay top rated.”
-	“Don’t be dishonest. Highlight your experience, and if you don’t have experience, say so. Explain you’re eager to get to work and willing to do what it takes to build a relationship with clients.”
-	“Treat the project as unique. Understand what the client is asking for, ask questions if necessary, explain why you are an added value to the particular project.”
-	 “I respond to messages and questions as quickly as possible, and try to understand the project details. Being honest is also the most important point.”
-	 “Clarify the work requirements if the job post is not specific enough. Then match your experience with what the work requires. For example, if the job calls for writing destination guides for RV campers, show similar samples from projects you’ve worked with (barring NDA clauses). You’re not only trying to win a job; you’re also trying to establish a good fit, which saves both you and the client wasted time and resources on finding the right person to work with.”
-	 “I always do my research when a potential client or company ahead of an interview in the event that they’ve shared enough to do so. I also pay attention to their needs in the job description and brainstorm solutions to bring up during the interview. Being in the headspace to remain clear, confident and prepared always makes a difference.”
-	“Talk about more than just projects or business. Sometimes talking about general stuff is also good because behind the scenes, we are all human.”
-	 “Honest communication and compromise. Like any relationship, it needs to have a balance.”
-	 “Open communication and mutual trust are the keys. Consistency, timelines, and reliability will keep the relationship strong.”
-	 “Listening skills. Speak less, and take in more information. Let them know what you’re doing to help and keep them updated.”
-	“To me, a successful project is one in which after the project concludes I feel empty inside when I realise it is over. This is the case because I do data analysis assignments, and I usually learn about new fields, issues, experiences, etc. from each project. Some clients are also so amazing that it almost feels like saying goodbye to an old friend when I finish working with them.”
-	 “Been writing for a travel and tour company based in Australia since 2013. I do the same for a US RV rental startup since 2018, and a Maui vacation condo rental service since 2019. Most of the projects I took on have turned long-term, and it has likely to do with the quality of work I turn in. I take the time to make sure my work meets client requirements, even if it takes a lot of time on my end. That way, my clients only need little time and effort in editing before hitting the ‘publish’ button.”
-	 “Worked for a company from the UK for four years, on what was then oDesk. It really showed me that you can have a normal remote job, with everything a normal one has like daily meetings, constant communication. It was wonderful and I hope I find that again.”
-	 “Email marketing revenue contribution to the overall store sales went from under 3% to 25% for Flos USA and from under 1% to 35% for The Blessed Seed. This includes both transactional and marketing emails. And both cases were deployed from scratch. What made these projects successful was a dedicated plan.”
