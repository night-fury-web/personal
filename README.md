If you want to work on some projects to learn skills, feel free to create an issue on this repository.

I have little experience in blockchain field as I don't have much time to study. It's in my future todo list, but afraid I may quit before learning it. :)

Blockchain auditing is another niche field which may take some time to get experienced. It's like bounty hunding job and a little risky to get paid. No need to focus on it for now. It's far away.
