### General

1. Professionals don't start sentence with lower letter. Upper letter on all sentences are recommended. Grammar and punctuations are also important.


### Discussion

1.	Instead of "You never listen to me," you could say "I feel like my perspective isn’t being fully considered in this conversation, and I’d appreciate it if we both made the effort to understand each others’ point of view and openly listened.”
2.	Instead of "You always make the same mistakes," you could say "I've noticed that there are some common errors that keep reoccuring and I'd like to discuss how we can avoid them."
3.	Instead of "You never follow through on your commitments," you could say “I’ve noticed that there have been instances where commitments haven’t been met, and I’d like to understand what may be causing this and how we can find a solution together."
4.	Instead of "You never take my feedback into consideration," you could say "I feel like my feedback isn’t being considered in our decision-making process, and I’d like to understand the reason for that."
5.	Instead of "You always do this wrong," you could say "I've noticed a difference in the approach we take to this task and I’d like to discuss it so we can align on a way forward.”

Instead of "You never consider how I’m feeling," you could say "I feel like my emotions aren’t being taken into account in this situation, and it would be helpful if we could both listen to each other's perspectives and find a way to make sure both of our needs and feelings are taken into account in any decisions or actions we take together.”

### Words

#### Eliminate below words to improve your credibility

1. "Fine"

When you say "fine" it sounds like you're not fine, and can be perceived as passive-aggresive, creating confusion and mistrust in the conversation. To avoid this, rather than saying "I'm fine" or "I'm fine with that", try using more positive, straightforward and assertive phrases such as "I'm ok" or "Sounds good." This clearly conveys that you are indeed in agreement or content with the situation, and avoids confusion.

2. "Unfortunately" 

This word can make bad news sound more negative than it truly is. Instead of saying "Unfortunately, I can't make it", try saying "I'm only free later in the month – how about we catch up another time?" This way, you're still conveying the same information, but in a less negative tone.

3. "Can't until" 

Instead of focusing on limitations or restrictions, try emphasizing what is possible. Rather than "I can't do Mondays", try expressing your availability by saying "I can do anytime after Tuesday." This way, you're communicating the same information but in a more positive and proactive manner.

4. "Honestly"

It’s advisable to avoid using the word "honestly" because it implies that your default is to lie – which is not what you want to convey. Rather than saying “To be honest, I didn't think we'd deliver on schedule," try "I didn't think we'd deliver on schedule."

5. “Kind of” or “Sort of” 

When used, these words can make you sound uncertain or indecisive in whatever you’re saying. Rather than saying "I kind of agree with you," try saying "I agree with you." Or, instead of “I'm sort of busy" try "I'm busy." 

#### Corporate buzzwords or jargon-y terms to consider replacing

1. “Synergize" / “Synergy” (Voted the most annoying buzzword few years ago)

This term is often used to describe the collaboration between two or more people, yet it can sound overly corporate and may not accurately convey the intended meaning to the listener. The word can also suggest that the collaboration is focused solely on optimising efficiency or achieving a desired outcome, rather than fostering collaboration. Instead, consider using more direct language, e.g. "collaborate" or "work together."

2. “Circle back" or “Put a pin in it” 

These phrases are often used to temporarily set aside a topic for discussion, but it can be perceived as dismissive or uninterested. Instead, consider more specific and inclusive language, e.g. "let's come back to this later" or "let's address this after we've covered these other points."

3. “Low-hanging fruit" 

This term is used to describe an easy opportunity or easily achievable goals, but it can be condescending as it implies that a task is simple or easy to accomplish, potentially downplaying the effort and skills required to complete it. Instead, consider using more respectful language like "easy opportunity" or "quick win."

4. "Take this offline" 

A common expression to suggest that a discussion or decision should be made privately, but the overuse can make it feel like a cliché. It can be seen as a convenient way to sidestep sensitive or controversial topics, and in some cases may be used as a way to avoid accountability or dismiss an issue. Replace it with "let's discuss this in private to ensure confidentiality" or "let's arrange a meeting to discuss in more detail". 

5. “Touch base" 

Often used to describe checking in or catching up, but it can sometimes be considered too casual for a professional setting, coming off as dismissive or leading to misunderstanding. Instead, consider using terms like "follow up" or "check in."

6. “Best practice" 

Often describes the most effective or efficient way to do something, but its overuse and lack of specificity can make it come across as vague and overused, potentially detracting from its intended meaning. Consider using more specific language like "most effective method”, “proven strategy”, or "most efficient process."

7. "Empower" 

A popular buzzword, this term is often used to describe giving someone the power or ability to do something, but it can be too vague and can come across as motivational fluff. Using more specific language can help clarify what is being offered and how it will help achieve the desired outcome, e.g. "give the means" or "provide the tools".

8. "Leverage" 

This often means to use a resource to gain an advantage, but can come across as vague or buzzword-y, losing the intended impact. Instead, consider specific and concise language, e.g. "utilise" or "take advantage of."

9. “Disrupt" 

This has become a popular buzzword in the business world, often used to describe innovation or large-scale change. But, its overuse can lead to a loss of impact and a perception that it’s a cliché. Instead, consider using “change”, “revolutionise”, or “transform."

10. “Drill down" 

Used to describe the process of examining a subject in detail, but it can be unclear and vague. Instead, consider using more specific language, e.g. "investigate" or "analyse."
